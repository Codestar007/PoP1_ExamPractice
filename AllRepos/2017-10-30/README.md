Examples for the PT class on Monday, 30th October, 2017

A number of examples which computes and print a number of characteristics about a range of integers.
- Test if n has no divisors other than itself and 1.
- Repeatedly apply the following procedure to n:
  - Square each of the digits of the number.
  - Add the squares together.
  If by doing this you eventually get to 1, then the number is *happy*
- Test if n is a triangular number.
- Test if n is a square number.
- Test if n is the sum of two square numbers.
- A number n is dishonest if there is a number k such that n//k = k, 
  but k*k is not n. A number is honest if it is not dishonest.
