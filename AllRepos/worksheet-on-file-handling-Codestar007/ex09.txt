With sequential access, you read aaccess all data prior to the data set you need.
An example if reading files oneline at a time and checking for a match. 
This is generally slowere than random access.

Whereas with random access, you can go to a specific data set without having to 
access the previous data sets. An example of random access is dictionaries or databses.
