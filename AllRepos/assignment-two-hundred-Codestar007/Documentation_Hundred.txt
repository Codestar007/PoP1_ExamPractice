    Program Title: Hundred
    Program Description: An interactive game in which two players take
                        turns to roll a die. At the end of each turn, the
                        score for that turn is added to the player's total
                        score. The first player to reach or exceed 100 wins.

FUNCTIONS
    ask_yes_or_no(prompt)
        Prints the prompt as a question to the player. Returns `True`
        if player responds with a string with first character 'y'mor 'Y',
        returns `False` if first character of player response is 'n' or 'N'
        else repeats question until the player provides an acceptable response.
    
    compare_scores(computer_score, human_score)
        This funcion constructs a comparison between the current human
        and computer_score and returns a string value.
        Arguments (Type):= current computer and human scores (*integer*).
    
    computer_move(computer_score, human_score)
        This function computes the computer rolls some number of times,
        displays the result of each roll, and the function returns the
        result (either 0 or the total of the rolls). The function uses an
        algorithim  to determine frequency of play: `gently` when computer
        is ahead and agressively if it is behind.
        Arguments (Type):= current computer and human scores (*integer*).
    
    human_move(computer_score, human_score)
        This function displays a player's and the computer's current
        score, and how far behind (or ahead) the player is. Then repeatedly
        asks whether the player wants to roll again. This continues until either:
        -   The player decides not to roll again. The function returns the
            total of the rolls made during this move.
        -   The player rolls a 1. The function returns 0.
        Arguments (Type):= current computer and human scores (*integer*).
    
    instructions()
        This function tells the player the rules of the game.
    
    is_game_over(computer_score, human_score)
        Returns `True` if either player has 100 or more, and the players
        are not tied, otherwise it returns `False`. Called only after
        the human player's move.
        Arguments (Type):= current computer and human scores (*integer*).
    
    main()
        The program starts execution here. It calls various
        functions; to print game instructions, execute computer and human
        player turns, check and apply fair play rule (if required), apply
        tie break and prints the game result.
    
    play_game(count_of_turns, c_turns, c_score, h_turns, h_score)
        Function is implemented to streamline the lenght of code in
        "main()". It takes 5 parameters; count of turns, computer
        turns, computer score, human turns, human score and returns the
        updated values as a 5 tuple (int).
    
    roll()
        Returns a random number in the range 1 to 6
    
    show_results(computer_score, human_score)
        Function is called when the game has ended to tell
        whether the human player won or lost, and by how much.
        Arguments (Type):= current computer and human scores (*integer*).
